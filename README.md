## Starting point / article

**Paper:** *Collective phases and long-term dynamics in a fish school model with burst-and-coast swimming*  
**Authors:** Weijia Wang, Ramón Escobedo, Stéphane Sanchez, Zhangang Han, Clément Sire, and Guy Theraulaz  
**Published:** 9 May 2025  
**DOI:** <https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240885>

The paper presents a model in which fish alternate between burst and coast phases, adjusting their motion according to local interactions. The authors identify distinct collective phases and transitions depending on model parameters. This will serve as our baseline for replication and extension.

## Planned contributions

We have some ideas on how to extend the original paper:

- Provide a more detailed model of the burst phase. The original paper models it as a discrete impulse, which is a simplification of real behavior.
- Model fish steering during the coast phase. In the original paper, each fish moves in a straight line during the coast.
- If we can find literature about this happening in nature, simulate interactions between different species of fish. Introduce additional paramters to govern interactions between different species.

Because we won't know for sure how viable each of these ideas is (e.g. the effects of a more detailed burst phase might turn out to be negligible) until we reproduce the original paper and perform some initial experiments, we can't yet fully commit to any of them.

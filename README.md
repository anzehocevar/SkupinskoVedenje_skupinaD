## Project Overview
This project focuses on modelling and analyzing **Collective phases and long-term dynamics in a fish school model with burst-and-coast swimming**. Building upon the paper *“Collective phases and long-term dynamics in a fish school model with burst-and-coast swimming”* (Wang et al., 2025), we aim to reproduce the authors’ results and extend the model to explore additional behaviours and environmental effects. Our broader goal is to understand how individual movement patterns and interaction rules give rise to collective states such as schooling, milling, and swarming.

## Starting Point / Article
**Paper:** *Collective phases and long-term dynamics in a fish school model with burst-and-coast swimming*  
**Authors:** Weijia Wang, Ramón Escobedo, Stéphane Sanchez, Zhangang Han, Clément Sire, and Guy Theraulaz  
**Published:** 9 May 2025  
**DOI:** [10.1098/rsos.240885](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.240885)

The paper presents a model in which fish alternate between burst and coast phases, adjusting their motion according to local interactions. The authors identify distinct collective phases and transitions depending on model parameters. This will serve as our baseline for replication and extension.

## Project Plan and Milestones
| Deadline | Goal | Description |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Report 1** | **Literature review and baseline model setup** | Review the paper in depth, understand the mathematical and simulation model, and reproduce the original experiments (burst-and-coast dynamics, phase transitions). |
| **Report 2** | **Model extensions and parameter exploration** | Add new behavioural or environmental factors (e.g. sensory noise, obstacles, leadership effects, or predator presence). Conduct parameter sweeps to examine stability and transitions. |
| **Report 3 (Final)** | **Validation, analysis, and discussion** | Compare our extended results with the original findings. Analyze emergent behaviour, visualize trajectories, and summarize conclusions for the final report. |
